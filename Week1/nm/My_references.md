abstract = {The PCORI mission is to address questions about health care from the patients' perspective, such as "What is my health status and its trajectory?" and "What are my treatment options and the expected benefits and harms of each?" The purpose of this PCORI-funded project is to make it easier for clinicians and patients to find valid answers to these and other clinical questions by using modern digital tools that support (1) learning from the experience of prior patients, and (2) translating what is learned to inform the decision at hand, taking into account each patient's unique circumstances. For this project, we developed and implemented statistical methods called bayesian hierarchical models that combine existing data on past clinical experience from a reference population with new measurements for the individual. Clinicians currently use such methods when screening patients for disease. Modern technologies make it possible for this proven approach to extend far beyond its current use. The recent revolution in information technology has unleashed new types of health data, from DNA sequences to functional images of the brain to patient-reported outcomes. Furthermore, the electronic health record captures every patient's sequence of health measurements, diagnoses, and treatments. The bayesian methods developed and reported on here combine even complex data to produce predictions about an individual patient's health status, trajectory, and likely benefits and harms of interventions. In addition to developing novel methods, we facilitated their use by creating and locally disseminating a software package, OSLER inHealth, that will allow other researchers to apply this methodology. The software repository is open-source and includes the methodology developed as part of this research as well as other existing methods that facilitate individualized health prediction. We have tested the proposed methods and software on 3 case studies to (1) estimate the frequency with which various pathogens cause children's pneumonia and predict which pathogen is likely to be causing a particular child's pneumonia given her or his clinical data, potentially reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics; (2) infer whether a prostate cancer is indolent or aggressive for a patient under active surveillance; and (3) characterize the variation in multiple, time-varying symptoms of major mental disorders, including schizophrenia and depression, and then use this knowledge to provide patient-specific estimates of past and, likely, future trajectories. With this project, we have developed and demonstrated the value of combining even complex measurements on a population of patients, then translating this experience into more valid assessments of a new patient's health status and trajectory. The model also supports inferences about the likely benefits and harms associated with available interventions. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020. Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

abstract = {Medical diagnosis is the basis for treatment and management decisions in healthcare. Conventional methods for medical diagnosis commonly use established clinical criteria and fixed numerical thresholds. The limitations of such an approach may result in a failure to capture the intricate relations between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of diseases. To explore this further, we have developed a freely available specialized computational tool that employs Bayesian inference to calculate the posterior probability of disease diagnosis. This novel software comprises of three distinct modules, each designed to allow users to define and compare parametric and nonparametric distributions effectively. The tool is equipped to analyze datasets generated from two separate diagnostic tests, each performed on both diseased and nondiseased populations. We demonstrate the utility of this software by analyzing fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin A1c data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Our results are validated using the oral glucose tolerance test as a reference standard, and we explore both parametric and nonparametric distribution models for the Bayesian diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.},

@article{VandeSchoot2021,
abstract = {Bayesian statistics is an approach to data analysis based on Bayes' theorem, where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data. The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution. The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events. This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.},

@article{Klauenberg2015,
abstract = {Regression is a common task in metrology and often applied to calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons or determine fundamental constants, for example. Yet, a regression model cannot be uniquely formulated as a measurement function, and consequently the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly. Bayesian inference, however, is well suited to regression tasks, and has the advantage of accounting for additional a priori information, which typically robustifies analyses. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future revisions of the GUM shall also embrace the Bayesian view. Guidance on Bayesian inference for regression tasks is largely lacking in metrology. For linear regression models with Gaussian measurement errors this tutorial gives explicit guidance. Divided into three steps, the tutorial first illustrates how a priori knowledge, which is available from previous experiments, can be translated into prior distributions from a specific class. These prior distributions have the advantage of yielding analytical, closed form results, thus avoiding the need to apply numerical methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Secondly, formulas for the posterior results are given, explained and illustrated, and software implementations are provided. In the third step, Bayesian tools are used to assess the assumptions behind the suggested approach. These three steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior uncertainty and model adequacy) are critical to Bayesian inference. The general guidance given here for Normal linear regression tasks is accompanied by a simple, but real-world, metrological example. The calibration of a flow device serves as a running example and illustrates the three steps. It is shown that prior knowledge from previous calibrations of the same sonic nozzle enables robust predictions even for extrapolations.},

@article{DeLeeuw2012a,
abstract = {In most research, linear regression analyses are performed without taking into account published results (i.e., reported summary statistics) of similar previous studies. Although the prior density in Bayesian linear regression could accommodate such prior knowledge, formal models for doing so are absent from the literature. The goal of this article is therefore to develop a Bayesian model in which a linear regression analysis on current data is augmented with the reported regression coefficients (and standard errors) of previous studies. Two versions of this model are presented. The first version incorporates previous studies through the prior density and is applicable when the current and all previous studies are exchangeable. The second version models all studies in a hierarchical structure and is applicable when studies are not exchangeable. Both versions of the model are assessed using simulation studies. Performance for each in estimating the regression coefficients is consistently superior to using current data alone and is close to that of an equivalent model that uses the data from previous studies rather than reported regression coefficients. Overall the results show that augmenting data with results from previous studies is viable and yields significant improvements in the parameter estimation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {Background: A Bayesian clinical reasoning model was developed to predict an individual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) for desk-top reference. Methods: Three Bayesian models were constructed to estimate the CVD risk by sequentially incorporating demographic features (basic), six metabolic syndrome components (metabolic score) and conventional risk factors (enhanced model). By considering clinical weights (regression coefficients) of each model as normal distribution, individual risk can be predicted making allowance for uncertainty of clinical weights. A community-based cohort that enrolled 64,489 participants free of CVD at baseline and followed up over five years to ascertain newly diagnosed CVD cases during the period through 2000 to 2004 was used for the illustration of the three proposed models (full empirical data are available from website http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/$\sim$chenlin/CVD-prediction-data.rar). Results: The proposed models can be applied to predicting the CVD risk with any combination of risk factors. For a 47-year-old man, the five-year risk for CVD with the basic model was 11.2% (95% CI: 7.8%-15.6%). His metabolic syndrome score, leading to 1.488 of likelihood ratio, enhanced the risk for CVD up to 15.8% (95% CI: 11.0%-21.5%) and put him in highest deciles. As with the habit of smoking over 2 packs per-day and family history of CVD, yielding the likelihood ratios of 1.62 and 1.47, respectively, the risk was further raised to 30.9% (95% CI: 20.7%-39.8%). Conclusions: We demonstrate how to make individual risk prediction for CVD by incorporating routine information with a sequential Bayesian clinical reasoning approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},
