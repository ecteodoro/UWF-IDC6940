**Paper 3: Abdullah, Hassan, & Mustafa (2022). “A Review on Bayesian Deep Learning in Healthcare: Applications and Challenges”**

**Goal**  
The paper systematically reviews how Bayesian deep learning (BDL) is being applied in healthcare: its use cases, methodological approaches, and the challenges and future directions.

**Importance**  
Healthcare data is often uncertain (noisy measurements, missing data, variability) and involves high stakes where mistakes can cost lives. While deep learning is powerful, it typically lacks mechanisms for representing uncertainty or handling limited data in a principled way. Bayesian techniques address these gaps by incorporating uncertainty, prior knowledge, and probabilistic reasoning—making models potentially safer, more trustworthy, and interpretable in clinical settings.

**Methods**  
- Conduct a literature survey of recent work combining Bayesian methods with deep learning in healthcare.  
- Categorize approaches such as variational inference, Monte Carlo dropout, ensemble methods, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian neural networks.  
- Map these methods to healthcare tasks like diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning.  
- Evaluate strengths/weaknesses in terms of data availability, computational costs, interpretability, uncertainty calibration, and privacy.

**Results & Limitations**  
- *Results*: BDL has shown success in disease classification, survival analysis, medical image segmentation, and predictive modeling. It often improves uncertainty quantification, may improve generalization, and provides clinicians with added information (e.g., confidence in predictions).  
- *Limitations*: High computational demands, scalability issues, difficulty specifying priors, and interpretability challenges remain. Many studies are proof-of-concept and lack validation in real-world clinical environments. Regulatory, privacy, and workflow integration concerns also limit deployment.
