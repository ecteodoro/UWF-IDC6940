**Paper 4: Baldwin & Larson (2017). “An Introduction to Using Bayesian Linear Regression with Clinical Data”**

**Goal**  
The paper introduces Bayesian linear regression as a practical tool for clinical researchers, explaining how it works, what advantages it provides over standard linear regression, and how it can be applied to real clinical data.

**Importance**  
Clinical data are often small-sample and noisy, with prior knowledge that could strengthen inference. Traditional frequentist regression produces point estimates and confidence intervals but does not naturally incorporate prior knowledge or fully quantify uncertainty. Bayesian regression addresses these gaps by incorporating priors, estimating full posterior distributions, and enabling richer, more nuanced inference.

**Methods**  
- Provide a tutorial-style explanation of Bayesian linear regression, including priors, posterior distributions, and inference.  
- Apply Bayesian regression to real clinical psychology datasets, showing modeling steps, prior choices, model fitting (likely via MCMC), diagnostic checks, and interpretation of posterior distributions.  
- Compare Bayesian regression outcomes with traditional frequentist regression to highlight differences in inference and interpretation.

**Results & Limitations**  
- *Results*: Bayesian regression enables probabilistic interpretations (e.g., probability that a parameter exceeds a threshold), incorporates prior evidence, and generates posterior predictive distributions that capture uncertainty in future observations. In practice, it often produced similar central estimates to frequentist regression but with more realistic uncertainty intervals.  
- *Limitations*: Bayesian methods require greater computational resources, especially for large datasets or complex priors. Prior specification is subjective and can bias results if poorly chosen. Additionally, limited training in Bayesian approaches may hinder adoption and correct interpretation among clinical researchers.
